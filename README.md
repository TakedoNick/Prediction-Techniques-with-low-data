# Prediction-Techniques-with-low-data
Predicting return on asset based on some indicators (“Magic Indicators”) that were generated by a black box algorithm. 

We are tracking many assets over an intra-day trading period. We denote the assets with a column named “asset id” and we denote time with the column “timestamp”. Furthermore, we have 4 static features namely: “return on asset” (the target variable), “company age” (age of the company), “company size” (Size of the company), “revenue” (Revenue of the company). Normally, we would think that these features would be time series, however, because we are looking at intra-day trading periods these features are static. The 12 “Magic Indicators” are all time series.

Given the low amount of data we are dealing with, we explore some creative techniques to extract patterns and make meaningful but accurate predictions.
